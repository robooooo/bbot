## BBot For Discord

### BBot

BBot is a a general-purpose discord bot with the killer feature of backing up pins to a dedicated channel in order to effectively bypass the 50-pin limit imposed by discord. It's written in C# with DSharpPlus and can be accessed using the `$` prefix or by mention.

### Main Commands

+ **Autobackup** will let you forget all about discord's silly 50-pin limit.
+ **Autopin** will help your community remember its best moments.
+ **Backup** helps you manage your servers by moving your pinned messages.
+ **Search** searches for a query on google.

+ **Changelog** posts the version information for BBot.

### The Backup Feature

The pin-backup feature is the main reason you'll want to be using bbot, and the reason it was written. It can take up to 50 pins from a channel and post them using a stylish embed in the channel of your choice, which makes it perfect for your server administration. It supports text, images, videos, embeds - just about anything. It provides direct links to posts so you can go back in case anything goes wrong, or if you're just curious about what went down when.
